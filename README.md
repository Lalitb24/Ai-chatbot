# AI Chatbot

A modern, AI-powered conversational chatbot built with Python and Hugging Face Transformers. This project demonstrates a simple yet effective dialogue system using DialoGPT (a GPT-2 model fine-tuned for chit-chat). It's console-based but extensible to web (e.g., via Flask or Streamlit).

## Features
- **AI-Driven Responses**: Uses a pre-trained transformer model for natural, context-aware conversations.
- **Context Retention**: Remembers the last few exchanges for coherent dialogue.
- **Customizable**: Easy to swap models or add rules-based fallbacks.
- **Lightweight Setup**: No external APIs needed; downloads model on first run.
- **Extensible**: Includes hooks for web deployment or integration with other tools.

## Demo
Run the chatbot and chat like this:
